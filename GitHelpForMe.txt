(You can ignore this file, really; it's for Git-Terminal newbies like me)

Git help for me because I just learned to use the command-line git:

~ git remote add <NAME> <URL>
    Adds a remote (shouldn't need to do this, but just in case)
~ git branch
    Base command for branches (shows current branch)
~ git checkout <BRANCH>
    Switches to <BRANCH>
~ git pull
    Pull changes from the remote repository
~ git merge
    Merge pulled remote changes with the local repository
~ git status
    Shows the current committed and uncommitted changes.
~ git add --all
    Adds all uncommitted changes to the next commit
~ git commit -m "<MESSAGE>"
    Commits all staged changes in the commit with "<MESSAGE>"
~ git push -u origin master
    Pushes the local "master" branch to the "origin" remote branch
