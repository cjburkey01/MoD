# MoD

A random little LWJGL project I decided to work on, I guess.

### Usage

#### Aquiring

Clone the repo using git or download with the GitHub master branch download.
If you chose to use git, it should look like this:
`git clone git@github.com:cjburkey01/MoD.git`

#### Setup

Setup is very simple; all you must do is run the correct commands below:
* Windows & Eclipse: `gradlew.bat eclipse`
* Windows & Idea: `gradlew.bat idea`
* Non-Windows & Eclipse: `./gradlew eclipse`
* Non-Windows & Idea: `./gradlew eclipse`

That should be it, really. Then just open the repo in your preferred IDE
